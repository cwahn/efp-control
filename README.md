# Eager Functional Programming - Math

"**Math module of EFP**" 

This header-only library is a mathematics module for the [Eager Functional Programming](github.com/cwahn/efp) library. It provides linear algebra, signal processing, both conventional, and modern control system-related features in a functional manner. 

The library is separated from EFP because of the dependence on Eigen, a linear algebra library.

## Features
